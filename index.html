            <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Regular expressions, commonly referred to as regex or regexp, are powerful tools used in text processing and pattern matching. They provide a concise and flexible way to search, validate, and manipulate text based on specific patterns.</p>
          <p>Understanding regular expressions is essential for web developers, data analysts, and anyone working with textual data. In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamental concepts of regex and how to use them effectively.</p>
          <p>Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with regex or an experienced developer aiming to deepen your knowledge, this tutorial will guide you through the key concepts and practical examples.</p>
          <p>Let's dive into the world of regular expressions and unlock their potential for text manipulation and pattern matching.</p>

        <section id="summary">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>we will focus on the regex pattern /^([A-Za-z]+)\s(\d+)$/. This regex pattern is designed to match and capture a specific format: a sequence of alphabetical characters followed by a space and then a sequence of digits. We will break down each component of this regex and explain its purpose..</p>

        <section id="anchors">
            <h2>Anchors and Start of Line</h2>

            <p> The anchor  is what starts and ends the regular expression. In the matching email code,</p>
            
            <code>/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/</code> 

            <p> the anchors are the <code>^</code> and the <code>$</code>. This code specifically is saying that we are looking for something that starts with</p>

            <code>^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)</code> 

            <p> we will define what everything inside the parentheses later in this tutorial, but what the anchor means is that if we are to find a match it has follow those initial guidelines. It also has to end with</p>

            <code>.([a-z\.]{2,6})$.</code> 

            <p>So, it must start and end with the given parameters within the code. If it does not, then it is not a match.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="quantifiers">
            <h2>Quantifiers</h2>
            <p> A quantifier is used to determine how many times a specific character or group of characters needs to be present in order to have a match. For instance, if we used the following code in our regex, xyz+ then this will match any string xy followed by at least one z. So, if we look at our code for matching the email:</p>

            <code>([a-z0-9_\.-]+)</code>
            
            <p> this will match any string that contains <code>a-z</code>, <code>0-9</code>,<code>_</code>,<code>.</code>,<code>or -</code>. The quantifier + means that it has to contain at least one of this in order to have a match.</p>

        <section id="grouping-constructs">
            <h2>Grouping Constructs</h2>
            <p> Contininuing with the code for matching an email:</p>

            <code>/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/</code>

            <p>  We can talk about grouping and capturing.</p>

            <p> <code>([a-z0-9_\.-]+)</code> is the first group that appears in our regex. This must be true before moving on to "match" the next part of the code. ([\da-z\.-]+) is the second group that appears in our regex. ([a-z\.]{2,6}) is the third group that appears in our regex.</p>

            <p>  When matching, we have to make sure we are following the guidelines of the group before moving on to the next group</p>
        </section>

        <section id="bracket-expressions">
            <h2>Bracket Expressions</h2>
            <p> Contininuing with the code for matching an email:

            <code> /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/</code>

            <p> We can talk about grouping and capturing.</p>

            <code>[a-z0-9_\.-]</code>

            <p> The guidelines for matching the group. For this code snippet, it can contain letters a-z, numbers 0-9, an underscore, hyphen, or period.</p>

            <p>  The period is an escaped character, so it required the backslash in order to be able to be matched.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="character-classes">
            <h2>Character Classes</h2>
            <p>  \d is present in the given matching email code and what it will match a single letter character, a-z, after the @ sign in the email address. Basically ensuring that a letter is matched after the @ in the email and not a number or special character.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="the-or-operator">
            <h2>The OR Operator</h2>
            <p>  It is not present in the code for the given matching email code, but in order to talk about the OR Operator, we will look at the following code for matching a hex code.</p>

            <code>/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/</code>

            <p> This is a regex for matching a hex code that uses the OR Operator. What this will do is it will match where it starts with the # and that has to come first followed by one of the following:</p>

            <p> <code>[a-f0-9]{6}</code> which will match a 6 character long string that contains a combination of a-f letters and 0-9 numbers.</p>

            <code>| OR Operator</code>

            <p><code>[a-f0-9]{3}</code> it will match a 3 character long string that contains a combination of a-f letters and 0-9 numbers.</p>


        </section>
        <section id="flags">
            <h2>Flags</h2>
            <p>  A regex flag is not used in the matching email code that is being used for this tutorial. A regular expression typically comes in the form:

            <code>/regex/</code>
            
            <p>  Where the slashes denote where the regular expresssion starts and ends. A flag can be used after the slash to give more guidelines for our matching. The flags are:</p>
            
            <p> g which stands for "global" which will allow for matching all the instances within a string that follow the matching guidelines set in the regular expression.</p>
            <p> m which stands for "multiline" which will search line by line rather than searching through a string as a whole.</p>
            <p>  i which stands for "insensitive" will make the regular expression case-insensitive, so capitals and lower-case letters will not deture the matching.</p>

        <section id="character-escapes">
            <h2>Character Escapes</h2>
            <!-- Content for this section -->
        </section>
        
        <section id="example">
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p> A more detailed explanation for each component of the regex pattern /^([A-Za-z]+)\s(\d+)$/:</p>
            <p>Anchors '^' and '$'
                Explanation: Anchors are used to specify where a match should begin and end within a line of text.</p>

            <p>Character Classes [A-Za-z] and \d
                Explanation: Character classes are used to define a set of characters that you want to match in a particular position of the text.</p>

            <p>Quantifiers '+'
                Explanation: Quantifiers are used to specify how many times a character or character class should occur in the text.</p>

            <p>Capture Groups (...)
                (...) creates a group to capture specific parts of the pattern. For example, ([A-Za-z]+) captures one or more letters.</p>
            
            <p>For example, if you had a list of people's names followed by their ages on separate lines, this regex could help you capture and separate the names and ages from each line.</p>
